-- Asset manifest for SDLFun.
--
-- Lists logical name -> file path for every game asset. Loaded at
-- startup by scriptLoadAssets (script.h), which walks the tables and
-- populates the engine-side registries (SoundLibrary for `sounds`,
-- AssetRegistry for `models` and `textures`).
--
-- .ent files reference models/textures by the short names below
-- (mesh=office_desk, tex=wood1, iqm=mrfixit). Unknown names fall
-- through as raw paths so one-offs still work without registering.
--
-- Name convention: short, lowercase, matching what game code / scripts
-- will pass to soundPlay("...") etc. File paths are relative to the repo
-- root (same convention as every other asset in the engine).
